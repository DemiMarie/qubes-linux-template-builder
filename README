The Template Builder
======================

1) First, create a clean image of Fedora Linux install. You can use the fedoraize_image
script for this:

fedorize_image <image> <file-with-packets-lists>

NOTE: The fedorize_image script can be also used to update an image -- it
automatically assumes the update mode if the <image> already exists.

2) Update symlinks in rpms_to_install_XXX/ so that they point to the current version
of Qubes-specific rpms to install you want to use (e.g. qubes-gui-vm, etc).

3) Now, you can "qubeize" the image. This must be done as root. E.g.:

# ./qubeize_image <img> <template-name>

4) Finally, build the Template RPM (do it as normal user, not root), e.g.: 

$./build_rpm <name>

The resulting rpm is stored in rpm/noarch directory.
